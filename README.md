# snow-overlay

This code creates a full-screen snowfall animation by dynamically generating multiple white, circular 'snowflake' elements that fall from the top to the bottom of the viewport using CSS animations. Each snowflake varies in size, position, and animation timing to create a natural, drifting snow effect.
